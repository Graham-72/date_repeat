# About Date_repeat for Backdrop


This module is a port to Backdrop of two parts of the Drupal 
contributed module 'Date': date_repeat and date_repeat_field.


## Status

This is an initial port to create date_repeat as a contributed 
module for Backdrop, separate from Date in core.

Work on porting/maintaining ceased after September 2015 and 
would need to resume if ever the Calendar module were to be 
successfully ported.
