# Date Repeat

:warning: **STATUS**:

> This module is not fully ported, and the somewhat hacky method that
> was used previously to modify that database schema to store the repeat rule
> is not a viable option in Backdrop. The [issue in question is here](https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/date_repeat/issues/18).

:arrow_right_hook: **RECOMMENDATION**:

> Move from this module to the [Repeating Dates](https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/repeating_dates)
> module, which was rewritten from the ground up by @indigoxela.


A Date Repeat API to calculate repeating dates and times from iCal rules.

The `Date Repeat Field` submodule creates the option of repeating date fields
and manages Date fields that use the Date Repeat API.
